# CINFER
CINFER uses an R implementation of Approximate Bayesian Computation to make these inferences from a computational model of CIN developed in NetLogo. We have shown that this method can recall experimentally observed mis-segregation rates as well as those most likely to have resulted in the karyotype diversity observed in patient-derived clinical samples.
